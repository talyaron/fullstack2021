      <h1>Finding the best car insurance company for you</h1>
      <p>Pricing and discounts made up a portion of each insurer’s score, but we know that cost is the top factor for many auto insurance shoppers<br> Since pricing is based on personal factors including your age, location, <br> and credit history and gender (in most cases), it’s important to shop around for car insurance quotes.</p>
    <p>If price is the most important factor in your search, comparing car insurance quotes can help you find the cheapest rate.<br> But your shopping experience will also shed light on a company’s customer service standards.</p>
    <h2>Insurance and investing for your many sides</h2>
    <h3>We've been protecting people, businesses and futures for more than 90 years.</h3>
