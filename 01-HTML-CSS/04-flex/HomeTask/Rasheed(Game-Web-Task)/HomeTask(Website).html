            <h1>Half-Life 2</h1>
            <p>What is it? It's the one that lets you fight alien 
               fascists by launching toilets at their heads.
               It feels trite to praise the many individual 
               advancements of Half-Life 2 (physics-based weapons, 
               keenly intelligent enemies, and characters that feel
               like more than walking quest-givers, to name a few) 
               because pretty much every video game ever has tried
               to do the same ever since. Just compare popular games 
               from before Half-Life 2 and after Half-Life 2 and its
               influence will be made immediately clear. But while 
               many foundational games are a bit of a chore to play
               these days, Half-Life 2 continues to hold up remarkably
               well. It's just as fun to launch an explosive barrel
               into a room full of helmeted goons now as it was
               in 2004. No really, try it!</p>

            <p>What is it? Ever since its debut as an expansive Half-Life mod, the Counter-Strike series has constantly
               stayed on top of the competitive shooter scene. And though CS:GO is now the de facto way to play this Terrorists
                vs. Counter-Terrorists FPS on PC, it originally started life as a modernized port for consoles. CS:GO is all about 
                tension: there are no respawns during rounds, Each map is meticulously crafted
                 to allow for myriad tactics requiring varying degrees of skill, CS:GO's
                   skill ceiling is practically in the stratosphere, and it puts equal emphasis on cooperative teamwork and heroic 
                   moments where you get all the glory.</p>

            <p>Battlefield 1 is a WW1 shooter that showcases a terrifying amount of carnage. It’s got all the familiar BF modes that we’ve grown to love, 
              including Conquest, This game works so well as a multiplayer shooter because of how finely it’s balanced - there’s no class, weapon, or tactic that gives an unfair
                advantage over others. By their very nature, WW1 weapons lack true precision and make up for this via brute force and close-quarters effectiveness,
                 so this really levels the playing field online. The maps are brilliant too, and they constantly change as the bombardment of explosives and ruined 
                 vehicles scar the landscape. Single-player is pretty enjoyable too, with the emotional war stories giving a sampler of the various</p>

        <p>A PC game, also known as a computer game, is a type of video game played on a personal computer (PC) rather than a video game console or
           arcade machine. Its defining characteristics include: more diverse and user-determined gaming hardware and software; and generally greater
            capacity in input, processing, video and audio output. The uncoordinated nature of the PC game market, and now its lack of physical media
            , make precisely assessing its size difficult.[1] In 2018, the global PC games market was valued at about $27.7 billion.</p>
