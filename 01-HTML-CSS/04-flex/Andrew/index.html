            Sharp like a katana sword, agile and just plain fast. The IZZO is a true everyday mountain bike with the
            usual YT DNA. A short travel trail bike that doesn't want to be an all mountain but a super light tool for
            classic trail riding. No matter whether you're headed out for a multi-day trip or just an after-work loop.
            The IZZO sets the standards. It's so!

                UNCAGED 6 could be translated to "the best there is", as these bikes really showcase what we can do with technology. The base of the build is a top-notch, Ultra-Modulus carbon frame with geometry that perfectly matches the intended use of the bike. Equipped with the most modern parts from SRAM, Crankbrothers and others, this is the perfect fusion of ultimate performance, new features, ease of use and a clean look. The stand-out highlight is of course the wireless, AXS-based Flight Attendant system from SRAM, which automatically and continuously controls the suspension to make your ride faster and more efficient.

            The CAPRA is a true legend. When we launched the first CAPRA in 2014, we changed enduro forever and set the
            benchmark. The current CAPRA followed the same path and became our fastest, most capable enduro bike ever.
            It will take you to where things get exciting: to the top of the big trails. Time to pin it. Whether you
            race the EWS, the local beer league, or you just like to hit your favorite bike park - the harder you
            charge, the happier the Goatman. The CAPRA is gravity focused.

                Anyone who has seen Return of the Goat immediately knows where the inspiration for the look of the Launch Edition of the new CAPRA comes from: the color and decals are more than a little reminiscent of the Goatman's van. But that's where the similarities end, because every single component of the Launch Edition bike is absolutely premium and anything but ordinary; from the RockShox ZEB Ultimate fork and the Cane Creek DB Kitsuma damper, to the eeWings crank made of titanium. This superlative bike is incredibly robust and focused entirely on performance - the Goatman likes this!            </p>
