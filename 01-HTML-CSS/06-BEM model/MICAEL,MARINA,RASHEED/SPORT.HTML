      <p class="text"><span>Premier League hits and misses: Liverpool back to their old, old selves? Plus:
          Super Bukayo Saka steps up again</span> Reflecting on last season, Klopp said 
         on Saturday: "I learned a lot. A lot!" A third of the season in, they are clearly back to their 
         best after those issues. But which version of their 'best', exactly?

         Some wondered whether Liverpool could return to their 
         title-winning form after the shock of 2020/21, but if anything, 
         they've returned to their old, old selves. This Liverpool feels much more like the side
          of 2017/18 and parts of 2018/19, where blitzes and high-scoring games were a trademark.
          The Norwegian, aged 21 years and 129 days, struck a late volley after coming on for his 50th Bundesliga appearance.

          Wout Weghorst had given Wolfsburg the lead before an Emre Can penalty and Donyell Malen effort turned the game.
          Dortmund briefly went top, but Bayern Munich beat Arminia Bielefeld 1-0 to go back above them.
          Leroy Sane's well-struck effort from outside the box helped Bayern Munich break a 44-year record. They have scored 102 Bundesliga 
          goals in 2021, beating Cologne's record of 101 in 1977.
          With their sixth win in the last seven league matches.</p>

      <p class="text"><span>Premier League hits and misses: Liverpool back to their old, old selves? Plus: Super Bukayo Saka steps up again

          </span>Have Liverpool returned to their
           pre-2019/20 version? Super Bukayo Saka steps up when it counts
            again, and Steven Gerrard is rewarded for making big calls. Plus is there trouble brewing at Leeds? 
            "I was not happy with the way we conceded chances today, to be honest."
            Jurgen Klopp's post-match assessment may seem odd after a 4-0 victory,
            but the scoreline didn't really tell the story. Southampton could and should have scored at
             least one, but by that reckoning, they could have also come away from Anfield having conceded double figures.
             his Liverpool side are completely relentless in the way they attack; so much so that warning signs barely register 
             with them. It's "you have a shot, we have a shot", safe in the knowledge they possess far more quality than the opposition.

             Substitute Deyverson pounced on an error by Andreas Pereira to slot the winner five minutes into extra time.
             
             Gabriel Barbosa had fired in at the near post to level in the second half for 2019 winners Flamengo in Montevideo - home to the first World Cup final.
             It came after Raphael Veiga opened the scoring early on for Palmeiras.

Veiga side-footed into the bottom corner for the defending champions, who have now won the competition three times.

      <p class="text"><span>Juventus lost at home to Atalanta for a fifth defeat in 14 league matches leaving them in eighth in Serie A.</span> 
         Duvan Zapata's 28th-minute winner stretched the visitors' unbeaten run to eight matches as they stayed fourth, four points behind leaders Napoli and seven points ahead of Juventus.

The hosts failed to threaten much, with Paulo Dybala's late free-kick hitting the crossbar.

The victory was Atalanta's first at Juventus since 1989.

Massimiliano Allegri's side have now only scored 18 goals in their 14 league matches, the lowest total in Serie A's top 10, and the loss follows their 4-0 defeat at Chelsea in the Champions League in midweek.
That took the game to extra time but Manchester United loanee Pereira's poor touch from Luiz's pass allowed Deyverson to run through and he made no mistake.
Palmeiras had to soak up pressure after the goal but held on to defend the title and celebrate jubilantly with their fans who had travelled from Sao Paulo.
Barbosa's leveller came with 18 minutes remaining, after former Chelsea and Arsenal defender David Luiz was earlier denied by goalkeeper Weverton.
