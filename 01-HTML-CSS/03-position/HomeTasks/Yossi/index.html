            <h1>Get the Right Setup</h1>
            “A good drawing begins with a good drawing setup,” says Skillshare instructor Brent Eviston in his
            course, 3D Drawing and Perspective.<br><br>
            First, he recommends investing in a drawing board that is larger
            than the paper you’ll be working with. Got it?<br><br>
            Now, make sure that before you start sketching, your line
            of sight is perpendicular to the drawing board. “If the drawing board is at any angle other than
            perpendicular to our line of sight, the drawing will become distorted, because one section of the paper
            will be closer to the eye than another,” he says.<br><br>
            To get the correct angle, try resting your drawing
            board on your knees and propping it up against the edge of a table.</p>

            <h1>Break Into Shapes</h1><br>
            Many drawing books show you how complex objects can be formed from basic shapes, and that’s for a
            reason.<br><br>
            “Shapes can really help us break down subjects into simpler parts, making them less intimidating to draw,”
            says Skillshare instructor Gabrielle Brickey in her course, Learn to Draw: Daily Practices to Improve Your
            Drawing Skills.<br><br>
            So if you’re looking to improve your drawing, observe images closely to understand the
            shapes that make them up. “Learning to see like this will be essential if you want to make something like
            stylized illustrations.<br><br>
            If you’re more interested in realistic representations, this will be important for
            arranging your subject on your canvas”.</p>

            <h1>Practice Drawing Them</h1><br>
            You’ve likely drawn the simple shapes above since you were a child. But according to Eviston, you really
            can’t get enough practice with easy sketches of shapes.<br><br>
            “I still make it a regular practice to draw circles,
            ovals, and straight lines, just because they are so common in drawing,” he says. “Over the course of my
            career, I have literally drawn tens of thousands… and will most likely draw tens of thousands more just
            because they are so important to continue to practice.”</p>

            <h1>Draw What You See</h1><br>
            When we set out to draw a familiar object, we often draw from our memories rather than the actual object in
            front of us.<br><br>
            So, if you’re sketching, say, an apple or a toy elephant, don’t look at the object as itself,
            but as an amalgamation of its parts. “Once we name those objects, what happens is that we stop looking very
            consciously at the object.<br><br>
            We draw what we know rather than what we see,” says Skillshare instructor Mandar
            Marathe. “Don’t try to name the objects. Just look at them as the shapes and lines and the angles.<br><br>
            We want to look at the objects very carefully and then draw accordingly.”</p>

            <h1>Sketching Upside Down</h1><br>
            If you’re struggling with the previous tip, try this exercise from Brickey’s course:<br><br>
            Take an image, turn it upside down, and try drawing it from that perspective, which will “help you rely less
            on symbols and more on
            what’s really in front of you,” she notes.<br><br>
            The exercise is particularly helpful before starting a new piece
            or when you’ve been looking at one for a while and need a fresh perspective. “This will help you make the
            brain shift to your creative right brain mode".</p>

            <h1>Draw the Negative Space</h1><br>
            A final tip from Brickley on drawing what you see in front of you: Draw the negative space around an object
            instead of the object itself.<br><br>
            “Drawing the negative space is one of my favorite tricks for drawing
            accurately,” she says. “When we draw the negative space or the negative shape, our left brain doesn’t have
            any preconceived symbol for this.<br><br>
            So it checks out, allowing our creative right brain to take the wheel.”

            <h1>Bring Emotion In</h1><br>
            Is a line just a line? No, according to Eviston, who teaches a tutorial that challenges students to draw
            lines with different emotions—angry, sad, calm, and more.<br><br>
            “Starting off with the specific and lofty
            intention of what you want to communicate is a wonderful way to stimulate your imagination and creativity,”
            he says. Plus, it can create a whole new element to your pencil sketches.<br><br>
            “Although we can never fully control or predict how the viewer will interpret a line, we have far more control than we often realize”.</p>

            <h1>Different Shading Tech</h1><br>
            “Shading techniques are very important,” says Skillshare instructor Antonia Dewey.<br><br>
            “They could easily define your artistic style.” But with so many different types of shading—hatching, cross-hatching, blending,
            stippling and so many more—which type is for you? Dewey recommends practicing all of them in order to find
            your favorite.<br><br>
            Try drawing one object, such as a tree, several times, then practicing multiple different
            shading techniques to fill it in. </p>
