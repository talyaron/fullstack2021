                  troubling twice over. The tightly packed opponents of pandemic lockdown measures
                   were at risk of spreading thecoronavirus. They also threatened to stir up an already tense political situation. 
                   Karl Nehammer, Austria’s interior minister, warned that anti-vaxxers in the Alpine republic are growing ever more radicalised. 
                   He called their demonstration “incensed” and “aggressive”. Some protesters were provocative in the extreme, carrying placards 
                   likening Alexander Schallenberg, Austria’s new chancellor  to Josef Mengele, the sadistic physician at the Nazi concentration
                    camp in Auschwitz. A few wore Judensterne, the yellow badges that the Nazi regime forced Jewish citizens to wear, with the 
                    inscription “unvaccinated” instead of “Jew”. The protesters marched against Austria’s increasingly tough measures against anti-vaxxers.

                   At least 130 people have been arrested, four wounded and several police officers injured since the violence began
