                <p>At least 46 people, including 12 children, died when a bus crashed and caught fire in western
                    Bulgaria, officials say.
                    The bus was registered in North Macedonia and most of those on board were tourists returning from a
                    trip to Istanbul in Turkey.
                    It rammed a crash barrier on a motorway south-west of the capital Sofia at about 02:00 local time
                    (00:00 GMT).
                    Seven people escaped from the bus and were taken to hospital with burns.

                    Ms Peng disappeared from the public eye for almost three weeks after making sexual assault

                <p>Covid infection rates have started rising sharply in parts of Western Europe, prompting the
                    introduction of fresh restrictions and lockdowns.
                    It has triggered fears the UK could follow suit. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Britain
                    will escape the worst of what is being seen on the continent. In fact, the UK may well be in the
                    strongest position of all to weather Covid this winter.
