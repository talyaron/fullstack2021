                            <h2> The Vanishing Glass</h2>
                            <p>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their
                                nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
                                The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number
                                four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room,
                                which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when
                                Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only
                                the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had
                                passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what
                                looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored
                                bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now
                                the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first
                                bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer
                                game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.
                                The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
                                Yet Harry Potter was still there.</p>

                            <h2> The Vanishing Glass</h2>
                            <p>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their
                                nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
                                The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number
                                four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room,
                                which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when
                                Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only
                                the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had
                                passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what
                                looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored
                                bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now
                                the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first
                                bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer
                                game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother.
                                The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.
                                Yet Harry Potter was still there.</p>

                            <p>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their
                                nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all.
                                The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number
                                four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living room,
                                which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when
                                Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only
                                the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had
                                passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what
                                looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored
                                bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now
