            <a href="https://www.pinkbike.com/news/throwback-thursday-7-bikes-turning-30-in-2022.html" class="main__resualt__title">Review: 7iDP Project 23 Carbon Helmet</a>
            <p class="main__resualt__text">The Project 23 Carbon sits at the very top of 7iDPs collection, a collection that not only includes
                helmets but also pretty much another other protective mountain bike wear you can think of. The helmet
                was built to be reasonably light, but places ventilation highest in its priorities. The design ethos
                seems to be about making something safe enough, whatever that weight is, and then making it as vented
                and comfortable as possible. I recently wrote an article about how I mistrust some enduro full-face
                helmets. In that, I argue that there are some far better executions than others, but I want my helmet to
                focus on protection primarily, with ventilation a distant second and that I would rather have something
                a bit heavier than something that feels light but unsubstantial. I would say the Project 23 Carbon
                manages to balance these priorities well. There is no flexing chin bar or gawky looks. Its a full-face
                helmet for riding mountain bikes that you just so happened to have pedaled to the top, not a helmet that
                is so concerned with being great for pedaling that it forgets to offer the protection that would have
                you reaching for a full-face in the first place. 7iDP says that this helmet was developed over a
                two-year period and was heavily influenced by EWS racers explaining how they wanted the compromise of
                weight and ventilation to lie. The result is a hardshell helmet that places an emphasis on airflow.</p>
