# AIRBNB

We made an app based on the already existing app: “AIRBNB”.
Which is used to find a place to stay for as many people as you want, for as long as you want and in varied locations.

This is a concluding class project of MongoDB and NodeJS subject. Also we used HTML, CSS, TypeScript, localstorage.

## Challenges

Some of the challenges we were trying to work with an existing data base provided by mongodb. Which didn’t work because of _small things_ in their schema. _what the way to resulve it_ .So we created a data base of our own.

# Install and Run

Install the dependencies

```
npm i
```

Start the server by

```
nodemon
```

## How to Use

Insert in the navigation bar the city you plan to stay in, and the amount of guests. Alternatively, you can press on one of the city cards for a list of options in that city. Then you press on a preferred Airbnb option in order to see more information.
