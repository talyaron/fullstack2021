# AIRBNB

We made an app based on the already existing app: “AIRBNB”.
Which is used to find a place to stay for as many people as you want, for as long as you want and in varied locations.

This is a concluding class project of MongoDB and NodeJS subject. Also we used HTML, CSS, TypeScript, localstorage.

## Challenges

Some of the challenges we were trying to work with an existing data base provided by mongodb. Which didn’t work because the MongoDB airbnb API samples schema had an issue with the captial letters, which multiplied the schemas and made the API unusable.We tried consult with our teachers and looking for answers from the internet, but nothing explained how to fix it. We tried changing the schema ourselves in the document and tried copying the document into the second schema .At the end nothing worked,so we created a data base of our own.

# Install and Run
