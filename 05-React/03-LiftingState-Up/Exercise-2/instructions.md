SIMPLE;

create app.tsx, with sky in the background. the app, will have a counter state. the counter will show the number of hits
create component of a ball
onclick on the ball, will add number to the counter in app.tsx;

MEDIUM:
the balls will fall from the sky.
each ball that hit the gound, will remove a point from the counter. if the ball was hit, it will not decrease a point.

HARD:
if the ball is hit, it will explode and disapear in smoke, with a noise.
Festival music wll play in the background.
