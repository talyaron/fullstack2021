                alt=" The Merge ($91.8 Million)
                Taking the number one spot as the most expensive NFT ever sold, there's The Merge by digital artist Pak. Pak is another big name in the NFT space, having created some of the most iconic artworks out there. The artist's actual identity remains a total mystery, but that hasn't stopped them from having a massive presence in the digital art space.

                Of all the NFTs Pak has created, The Merge is their most creative. Rather than creating and selling a static piece of art, The Merge was a collection of 'masses' that people could buy. The more folks spent, the larger their 'mass' got. All of these masses are lumped under the same creation, and with total sales coming out to $91.8 million, it makes The Merge the most expensive NFT sale by a mile.">

                alt="The First 5000 Days ($69 Million)
                In its first-ever digital art auction, the auction house Christie's sold a massive compilation of artworks by Beeple for a record-breaking sum of 69 million. Beeple has been making artworks every day since May 2007, not missing a single day.

                These art pieces dubbed as Everydays vary in terms of styles, medium, and content and often rely on dystopian or satirical settings. As per Artnet, Beeple happens to be the `third most expensive living artist` in terms of auction prices, following the likes of Jeff Koons and David Hockney.">

                alt="Human One ($28.9 Million)
                his is yet another NFT from Beeple, and while it's not the artist's most expensive creation, it may just be his most unique. Unlike most NFTs which are exclusively digital, Human One is a hybrid design that also combines physical elements. It's a human-sized sculpture made out of polished aluminum, mahogany wood, and four video screens creating a combined total resolution of 16K.

                The coolest part? Those screens display a virtual avatar that'll keep changing for years to come. Beeple says he'll keep updating the avatar for as long as he's alive and make any changes he sees fit. If someone's going to spend nearly $29 million on an NFT, they might as well get one as cool as this.">

                alt="CryptoPunk `#`7523 ($11.7 Million)
                A digital avatar selling for over $7 million is undoubtedly impressive. But what about one that fetched a sale price of nearly $12 million? That's what happened with CryptoPunk $7523, which was purchased by DraftKings' shareholder Shalom Meckenzie for $11.7 million.

                CryptoPunk #7523 is also part of the Alien series, though it has a few different accessories compared to its #7804 and #3100 siblings. This NFT has a red beanie, a gold earring, and a face mask. Combined with the rare Alien skin, it makes CryptoPunk `#`7523 one of the most iconic (and expensive) digital creations out there.">

        <p><h3>WHAT IS AN NFT? WHAT DOES NFT STAND FOR?</h3>
            Non-fungible token.
            
            That doesn’t make it any clearer. <hr>
            
            Right, sorry. “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. <hr> For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. <hr> But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original.</p>
